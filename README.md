# Awash dopamine study code

This repository contains code used for the analyses in Bergey et al 2016, 
["Dopamine pathway is highly diverged in primate species that differ markedly in social behavior,"](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/04/26/1525530113.full).
The pipeline is controlled by a Makefile (awash_analysis.mk), which calls the various scripts.
These were all (somewhat inelegantly!) pulled out of a larger repository
and are very specific to the task for which they were written, but
please let me know if you would like a hand in adapting them to another purpose!
